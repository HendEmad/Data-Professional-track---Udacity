## **Overview:**
Analyzing a dataset and then communicating my findings about it , using the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make my analysis easier.

## **Introduction:**
This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row. Some of them are:
* `ScheduledDay` tells us on what day the patient set up their appointment.
* `Neighborhood` indicates the location of the hospital.
* `Scholarship` indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program Bolsa Família.
* `No_show` it says ‘No’ if the patient showed up to their appointment, and ‘Yes’ if they did not show up.

## **Libraries installation:**
```
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
pip install seaborn
```
## **Progress outline:**
