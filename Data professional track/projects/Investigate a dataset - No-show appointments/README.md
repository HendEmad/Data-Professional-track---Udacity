**Overview:**
This was the second project in Data Professional track from Udacity provided by fwd. In this project, I analyzed Medical Appointment No Shows Dataset and communicated my findings about it using Python libraries NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, and seaborn. The dataset collects information from 110k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment.

**Progress outline:**
Using data analysis process to explore this data set answer questions:

1. Clean data
2. Explore data
3. Answer questions by visualizing the data
4. Make conclusions
