 ## reasons for creating visuals using data
 1. Exploratory analysis
 2. Explanatory analysis.
 
 ## 1. Exploratory analysis:
 - It is done behind the scenes, to look for the relationships (patterns) in data.
 - Connect to questions we asked about data after collecting it.
 - Doesn't need to be perfect, as only us are the consumers of these plots and only our questions will  be answered using them
 
## 2. Explanatory analysis:
- It is done when you are providing your results for others. These visualizations need to provide you the emphasis necessary to convey your message. They should be accurate, insightful, and visually appealing.

## The five steps of the data analysis process:
1. Extract the data: Obtain the data from a spreadsheet, SQL, the web, etc.
2. Clean the data: fix missing values, determine which columns to keep, round values, or perform some other tricks to get the data in a way that you can analyze it.

_**note**_ in this step, we could use exploratory visuals to find the correlation of each column of the data to decide which variabls have an effect on our insights or the output.

4. Explore the data: Here we use exploratory visuals (The visuals used for cleaning, exploring, and analyzing the data are part of exploratory visuals. The Visualization here and in the previous step don't need to be super pretty or super clean in their messages as their are our own plots only to determine what is going on ths data.

5. Analyze the data: Here we might use either exploratory or explanatory visuals after choosing thr best analysis for answering our questions. examples: predicting sales, fraud, and home prices

6. Share the insights: When we find an insight to share the visuals used for sharing these insights are part of explanatory visuals.

## Visual encoding:
Mapping from the data to display elements. Display elements include position on the x-axis or y-axis, the size of points or charts, the shape of points, texture, angke, length, etc..

for quantitative data -->length (position along an axis), length.

## Chart Junk:
Chart junk refers to all visual elements in charts and graphs that are not necessary to comprehend the information represented on the graph or that distract the viewer from this information.

## Design Integrity 
- It is key that when you build plots you maintain integrity for the underlying data.
- One of the main ways for looking at data integrity was with the lie factor. Lie factor depicts the degree to which a visualization distorts or misrepresents the data values being plotted. It is calculated in the following way:

 The delta symbol (Î”) stands for difference or change. In words, the lie factor is the relative change shown in the graphic divided by the actual relative change in the data. Ideally, the lie factor should be 1: any other value means that there is some mismatch in the ratio of depicted change to actual change. The larger the lie factor, the more misleading information.
 
 **_Example:  comparing the largest to the smallest doctor in terms of pixels._**

The number of pixels related to the largest image is 79,000 and 16,500 for the smallest. The percentage change is 27% to 12%. So, the lie factor is calculated as:

***Tip for choosing Explanatory visualization colors*** --> 
- To be sensitive to those with colorblindness, you should use color palettes that do not move from red to green without using another element to distinguish this change like shape, position, or lightness. Both of these colors appear in a yellow tint to individuals with the most common types of colorblindness. Instead, use colors on a blue to orange palette.

## Telling stories
Telling stories with data follows these steps:
1. Start with a Question
2. Repetition is a Good Thing
3. Highlight the Answer
4. Call Your Audience To Action
