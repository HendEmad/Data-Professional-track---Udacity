## What is the difference between Split and Custom Split?
 Split splits on a Tableau “guessed” character, but Custom Split can split on a value you specify.

## JOINs

- We use UNION instead of JOIN to combine two sheets stacked on top of one another that have all the same columns.
- There are three main products that you can create using Tableau:
1. WorkSheets: for one visualization.
2. DashBoards: Multiple visualizations.
3. Stories: Combination of worksheets and dashboards.

## Combining data
Often you're going to want to combine data from multiple sources, such as different tables in a database or sheets in an Excel file. For example, you might want to include the information from the People sheet with the Orders sheet so you can analyze the performance of each salesperson.

## Union
If you drag People below Orders, you get a union. Unions stack the data on top of each other, the second sheet ends up being appended to the end of the first sheet. _**This works great if you have multiple sheets with columns in common as the columns will match up**_. However if the columns are different, then you'll get a lot of "nulls" because columns are created for both sheets, but the first sheet doesn't have data for the second sheet's columns.

-  Instead of stacking the data on top of each other, joins combine data from the sheets based on common values. In our case, both Orders and People have a column Region that we can use for the common values.

Tableau does an "inner join" by default. This combines the data wherever there is a common value. So when Region in Orders is "East", it takes the data from People where Region is "East". Above you can see the Person column from People has been added to the data from Orders.

The sheet looks:

- The data columns are also called ```fields``` and splitted between dimensions and measures.
- Catrgorical, Qualitative, and time data are listed as ```dimensions```.
- Quantitative numerical data is listed as ```Measures```
- We can convert Quantitative data from discrete to continuous and vise versa, but this can't be dome on caterogical data ```as it can't be continuous```.
- For Tableau version 2020, the no.of records is not calculated automatically. To find it:
1. Click on a small drop-down arrow at the top left corner just above the tables (dimensions) and select "Create Calculated Field". See the screenshot below.

2. This will open a small window where you write formulas to perform calculations on data.

3. Change the calculation name to the Number of records (or you could write any name you want to) just as shown in the above image, then enter 1 in the field below and click on "OK" This will create a calculated field with the name "Number of records" in the measures pane.

- =# sign signifies that the record is a "Calculated Field"
- ```IMP``` The reason for using 1 in step 3 is that each 1 is a representation of one record in the data. So, when you drag it to the rows pane, the calculated field "Number of records" takes an aggregate form of the sum which gives us the total number of records for each market.
- Secondly, You can also use the Orders (Count) measure, which is the same as the Number of Records. However, instead of using sum (number of records), you need to use count as the aggregation for Orders(count).

## Hierarchies
They give us the ability to drill down into our data. Tableau automatically makes hierarchies for timebase data. 

- Note → The line plot in Tableau By default is for time data.

```For example``` if we want to show the relationship between profit and order date: 

![20](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91827137/164582091-40684c59-ddea-4570-ab03-2422d42abbf4.PNG)

If we click on ‘+’ that is exist is the side of YEAR(Order Date), we will get the hierarchy of Year which is QUARTER(Order Date) as shown:

![21](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91827137/164582122-516eea59-f266-477a-9185-3e56b1cb9b3e.PNG)

If we click on + beside the QUARTER,  we will get the hierarchy of QUARTER which is MONTH, and then DAYS and so on as shown:

![22](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91827137/164582179-d5d47a89-3d57-47d4-99b2-1a2db9279604.PNG)

But if we tried to show only MONTH(Order Date), we will get this:

![23](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91827137/164582243-9e4df1e5-bdd9-4db3-be89-0ab99a674b64.PNG)

```NOTE```
- It is expected to show a monthly profit over the four years in the data. However, there is only one value for each month. 
- ```Tableau is doing this because the order date has been set to the discrete data type. So it aggregates the profit values for each month, that is each value is the sum of profit for that month over the four years in the data(this means that Tableau aggregates over all records for each value by default).```
- To change how this is being plotted, we need to convert the order date to a continuous data type. 

## Manual hierarchies

For example, each value in Sub-Category belongs to one in the Category. For example, a record with the Sub-Category value "Bookcases" always has a Category value of "Furniture." There is a hierarchy here where the Sub-Category values branch out from Category values.

You can make a hierarchy by selecting both Category and Sub-Category.

## Groups and Sets
Ways to group data in tableau.

```Groups``` Static, the members will always be the members. No new data can join the group
- You might group items for lots of reasons. Most often it occurs when you find certain observations in a histogram or scatterplot, and you want to see how they are related to other parts of your data.

```Sets``` Dynamic, the members change when data is updated.
- With more than a binary split (just two categories), using a Group or Set might not be the best option. Instead, you should use a Calculated Field.

## Quiz
Determine what type of grouping is best for each scenario:
1. We want to look at which rows have shipping costs under 50. This should be updated each time a new item ships for under 50. → ```Set```.
2. We notice that there are a few outliers in a scatterplot of Price vs. Sales, and we want to look at how those items are related to one another in a plot of shipping costs. → ```Group```.
3. We want to create 5 categories of profits - very high, high, medium, low, and very low performers. → ```Neither a Group nor Set```

## Calculated Field: 
They create new fields from the underlying data, such as creating revenue by multiplying price times quantity.
- What is the profit ratio for a single order within any product or any other category level?
```Use Average [Profit]/[Quantity]```
- What is the profit ratio at any level of a category?
```Use SUM([Profit])/SUM([Quantity])```

## Conditional statements
- As in Excel and most programming languages, you can use conditional statements like IF, THEN, ELSE in calculations. For example to make a new field to categorize sales as "good" and bad", you could do:
```IF SUM([Sales]) > 10000 THEN "Good" ELSE "Bad"```

- You'll use this pattern a lot, there is a shorthand version with the function IIF. The function works like IIF(conditions, if true, if false):
```IIF(SUM([Sales]) > 10000, "Good", "Bad")```

## Table Calculations
Calculations that are created from the results of visualization.
