In this project, you'll create visualizations to reveal insights from a data set. You will create data visualizations that tell a story or highlight patterns in the data set

1. [Flight Delays and Cancellations](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2017/December/5a3b1fad_flight-delays/flight-delays.zip)

This data comes from a Kaggle dataset, it tracks the on-time performance of US domestic flights operated by large air carriers in 2015.

The file you must use in creating your data visualizations is the flights.csv file. The other two provided files may be used in conjunction with the flights.csv file, but should not be used alone.

You are required to create three visualizations. Some questions you may attempt to answer include those pertaining to the following areas:
1. Which airlines or airports have the worst delays?
2. What causes delays?
3. You can also come up with your own question!
