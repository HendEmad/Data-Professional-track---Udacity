Question 1.3: Who is the best customer?
The customer who has spent the most money will be declared the best customer. Build a query that returns the person who has spent the most money. 
I found the solution by linking the following three: Invoice, InvoiceLine, and Customer tables to retrieve this information, but you can probably do it with fewer!

Check Your Solution
The customer who spent the most according to invoices was Customer 6, with 49.62 in purchases.

Question 2.1
Use your query to return the email, first name, last name, and Genre of all Rock Music listeners (Rock & Roll would be considered a different category for this exercise).
 Return your list ordered alphabetically by email address starting with A.

Check Your Solution
From my query, I found that all of the customers have a connection to Rock music (you could see this by looking at the original length of the customers table). 
Your final table should have 59 rows and 4 columns (if you want to check the connection to 'Rock' music).

Question 2.2: Who is writing the rock music?
Now that we know that our customers love rock music, we can decide which musicians to invite to play at the concert.

Let's invite the artists who have written the most rock music in our dataset. Write a query that returns the Artist name and total track count of the top 10 rock bands.

You will need to use the Genre, Track , Album, and Artist tables.
//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 2.3: 
First, find which artist has earned the most according to the InvoiceLines?
Now use this artist to find which customer spent the most on this artist.
For this query, you will need to use the Invoice, InvoiceLine, Track, Customer, Album, and Artist tables.

Question 3.1:
We want to find out the most popular music Genre for each country.
We determine the most popular genre as the genre with the highest amount of purchases. 
Write a query that returns each country along with the top Genre. 
For countries where the maximum number of purchases is shared return all Genres.
//----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 3.2:
Return all the track names that have a song length longer than the average song length. 
Though you could perform this with two queries. 
Imagine you wanted your query to update based on when new data is put in the database. 
Therefore, you do not want to hard code the average into your query. 
You only need the Track table to complete this query.
//----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 3.3:
Write a query that determines the customer that has spent the most on music for each country. 
Write a query that returns the country along with the top customer and how much they spent. 
For countries where the top amount spent is shared, provide all customers who spent this amount.
