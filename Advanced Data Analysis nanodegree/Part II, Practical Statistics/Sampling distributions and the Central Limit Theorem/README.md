## Descriptive vs. Inferential Statistics
***Descriptive Statistics*** :describing collected data.
***Inferential Statistics*** :Drawing conclusions about a population of individuals baesd only on a ```sample``` of individuals from that population.

## sampling distribution
the distribution of a statistic.

### Quiz
1. The mean of the sampling distribution ----> P
2. The variance of the original 1,0 values ----> P(1-P)
3. The variance of the proportions calculated from 20 randomly selected values iterated 10,000 times ----> P(1-P)/20

### Notes
- The sampling distribution is centered on the original parameter value.
- The sampling distribution decreases its variance depending on the sample size used. Specifically, the variance of the sampling distribution is equal to the variance of the original data divided by the sample size used. This is always true for the variance of a sample mean!
- In notation, we say if we have a random variable, **X**, with variance of **σ^2** , then the distribution X` (the sampling distribution of the sample mean) has a variance of **(σ^2) / n** 

* All parameters pertain to a population, while all statistics pertain to a sample.
* we commonly use Greek symbols as parameters and lowercase letters as the corresponding statistics. Sometimes in the literature, you might also see the same Greek symbols with a "hat" to represent that this is an estimate of the corresponding parameter.
