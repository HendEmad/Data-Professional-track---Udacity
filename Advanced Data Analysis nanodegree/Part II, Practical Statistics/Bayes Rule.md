If specific cancer occurs in 1% of the population (P(C) = 0.01), and a test for this cancer is with a 90% chance if they have this C (usually called sensitivity), and there is another 90% chance it is negative if we don't have C ( usually called specificity). What do you think is the probability of having that specific type of cancer?

So, we have P(C) = 0.01 
            90% is positive if you have C.
            90% is negative if you don't have C.
     question: Test = Positive, probability of having cancer = ?

Using the probability provided above. What is the probability that there is truly cancer if someone has a positive test P(Cancer|Positive)?
