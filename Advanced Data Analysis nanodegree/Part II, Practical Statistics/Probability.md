## Probability:
- In probability, we make predictions about the future events based on causes that we assume (You predicting data).
- In Statistics, we analyze the data from the past events to infer (understand) what those causes could be (You are using the data to predict). 
- The probability of a fair coin notation is — P(Heads) = 0.5.
- Probability Law — P(Heads) + P(Tails) = 1
- The formula applies to anything that has only two outcomes — P(Outcome 1) + P(Outcome 2) will always equal 1

***note*** (Fair coin is one whose two parts have the same frequency to appear)

- Probability Formula — The probability of P (A) = 1− P (¬A).

--> This reads the probability of A = 1 minus the probability of not A.

- Probability is a number between 0 and 1
- Truth Table size for coin flips is determined by the number of sides (Head/Tail) with an exponent equal to the number of flips. So 10 flips of a coin would have a Truth Table size of 
210  or 1024.

--> So, P(H, H) = P(H, T) = P(T, H) = P(T, T) = 0.25 — in fair coins.
Another way to calculate this → P(H, H) = P(H) * P(H) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25

→ If we flipped the fair coin twice, there are two cases where we can see heads once which are (H, T) & (T, H) – Here, the head appears only one time in each case. So, to figure out the probability of heads coming up just once, we add the probabilities together: 
P(H) = P(H, T) + P(T, H) = 0.25 + 0.25 = 0.5

→ Rolling 1 Heads in Three Flips:
