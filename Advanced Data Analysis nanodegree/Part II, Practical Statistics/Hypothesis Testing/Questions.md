### `1.` Consider the following statement: "Dyson air purifiers are the best.", Which set of hypotheses could accurately test this statement?

- Null: Dyson air purifiers are not the best. Alternative: Dyson air purifiers are not the best.
- Null: Dyson air purifiers are the best. Alternative: Honeywell air purifiers are not as good as Dyson air purifiers.
- ***Null: Dyson air purifiers are not the best, Alternative: Dyson air purifiers are the best.***
- It's impossible to set up null and alternative hypotheses based on the above example.

`Notes`: 
- The null and alternative hypotheses should be competing, non-overlapping hypotheses.
- This statement suggests that the individual believes that Dyson air purifiers are the best. Then the competing, non-overlapping alternative hypothesis is that the Dyson air purifier is not the best. Even if we should better define metrics aimed at "best", this does constitute a null and alternative based on this statement.

### `2.` Consider the following statement: "The average height of a human is smaller than or equal to 70 inches, "Which set of hypotheses below is correctly set up based on this assertion?

- Null: The average height of a human is greater than 70 inches. Alternative: The average height of a human is smaller than or equal to 70 inches.
- Null: The average height of a human is greater than 70 inches. Alternative: The average height of a human is not greater than 70 inches.
- ***Null: The average height of a human is not greater than 70 inches. Alternative: The average height of a human is greater than 70 inches.***
-  It's impossible to set up null and alternative hypotheses based on the above example.

`Note`: The null is usually set up with an equal (you can image less than or equal to 70 here). The one-sided part of the hypothesis is generally placed in the alternative hypothesis.
