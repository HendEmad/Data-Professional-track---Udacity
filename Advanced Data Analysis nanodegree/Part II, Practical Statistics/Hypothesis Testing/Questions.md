### `1.` Consider the following statement: "Dyson air purifiers are the best.", Which set of hypotheses could accurately test this statement?

- Null: Dyson air purifiers are not the best. Alternative: Dyson air purifiers are not the best.
- Null: Dyson air purifiers are the best. Alternative: Honeywell air purifiers are not as good as Dyson air purifiers.
- ***Null: Dyson air purifiers are not the best, Alternative: Dyson air purifiers are the best.***
- It's impossible to set up null and alternative hypotheses based on the above example.

`Notes`: 
- The null and alternative hypotheses should be competing, non-overlapping hypotheses.
- This statement suggests that the individual believes that Dyson air purifiers are the best. Then the competing, non-overlapping alternative hypothesis is that the Dyson air purifier is not the best. Even if we should better define metrics aimed at "best", this does constitute a null and alternative based on this statement.

### `2.` Consider the following statement: "The average height of a human is smaller than or equal to 70 inches, "Which set of hypotheses below is correctly set up based on this assertion?

- Null: The average height of a human is greater than 70 inches. Alternative: The average height of a human is smaller than or equal to 70 inches.
- Null: The average height of a human is greater than 70 inches. Alternative: The average height of a human is not greater than 70 inches.
- ***Null: The average height of a human is not greater than 70 inches. Alternative: The average height of a human is greater than 70 inches.***
-  It's impossible to set up null and alternative hypotheses based on the above example.

`Note`: The null is usually set up with an equal (you can image less than or equal to 70 here). The one-sided part of the hypothesis is generally placed in the alternative hypothesis.

### `3.` Consider we are interested in testing if the average revenue for a new marketing campaign is better than the previous marketing campaign.

We set up the null and alternative hypotheses in the following way:

H0: μn - μo ≤ 0 --> old:better

H1: μn - μo > 0 ---> new:better

where μo is the mean revenue of the old campaign, and μn is the mean revenue of the new campaign.

`a.` If you were to describe the null hypothesis using words from the real-world context, how would you state it?

Answer --> The mean revenue of the new page minus the old page is less than or equal to zero --> this means that the new page doesn't generate as much revenue as the old page.

`b.` If you were to describe the alternative hypothesis using words from the real-world context, how would you state it?

Answer --> The alternative hypothesis is that the mean revenue of the new page is greater.

`c.` Use the setup of the above to match the error statements to the correct errors.
- Deciding the new page is better. ---> Not enough information to provide an error
- Deciding the old page is better. ---> Not enough information to provide an error
- Deciding the new page is better, but really the old page is better. ---> Type I Error
- Deciding the old page is better, but really the new page is better. ---> Type II Error

### `4.` Consider you are testing a new cancer drug to see if it reduces tumor sizes in patients. Let μn be the average reduction in tumor size under the new drug. Let μo be the average reduction in tumor size under the old drug.

We set up the null and alternative hypotheses in the following way:

H0: μn - μo <= 0

H1: μn - μo > 0

`a.` What does the null hypothesis suggest?

Answer --> The old treatment will reduce tumors as well or better than new treatments(on average)

`b.` Which of the following statements is another way to state the null hypothesis in this situation?

Answer --> The null is that the old drug works as well or better then the new drug.

`c.` Use the setup of the above null and alternative hypotheses to match the error statements to the correct errors.

- The new drug is better at reducing tumor sizes. ---> Not enough information to provide an error.
- The old drug is better at reducing tumor sizes. ---> The old drug is better at reducing tumor sizes.
- Based on the study results we decide the new drug is better, but really the old drug is better at reducing tumor sizes. ---> Type I Error.
- Based on the study results we decide the old drug is better, but really the new drug is better at reducing tumor sizes. ---> Type II Error.

### NOTE
` Type I Errors ---> Choosing H1 when H0 is true.`
` Type II Errors ---> Choosing H0 when H1 is true.`
