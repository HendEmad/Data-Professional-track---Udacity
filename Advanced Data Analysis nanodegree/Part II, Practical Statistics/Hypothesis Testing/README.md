We use it to find the assumption of something existance or not.

For example: if the packaging on a loght bulb states that the bulb will last 500 hours under normal use. A consumer advocate would like to know if the mean lifetime of a bulb is less than 500 hours! There are two assumptions in this case. this statement is true or false?

- for sure, we will not test each bulb, but we will take a sample data from them.
- We test these types of statements using sample data because it is usually impossible to gain access to the entire population. This procedure we use to test such statements is called ***Hypothesis Testing***. 

- `If population data are available, there is no need for inferential statistics!`

- The statement can be either true or false. So, the hypothesis testing is based in two types of hypotheses which are: Null hypothesis & alternative hypothesis.
    1. Null hypothesis: H0
        * No change, no effect.
        * It is assumed true until evidence indicates otherwise.
        * It is the condition we believe to be true before we collect any data.
        * Mathematically, It is a statement of equal two groups or an zero-effect.
        * It holds some sort of equal signs: =, ≤, ≥
    2. Alternative hypothesis: H1
        * It is a statement that we are trying to find evidence to support.
        * It is what we would like to prove to be true.
        * It holds: ≠, >, <
* The H0 and H1 are competing, non-overlapping hypotheses.

- There are three ways to setup the null and alternative hypotheses:
1. two-tailed test --> Equal hypothesis versus not equal hypothesis
    H0: parameter = some value
    H1: parameter ≠ some value
2. left-tailed test(One tailed test) --> Equal versus less than
    H0: parameter = some value
    H1: parameter 6 some value
3. right-tailed test(One tailed test) --> Equal versus greater than
    H0: parameter = some value
    H1: parameter 7 some value
    
`Example:` 

* In the US judicial system, we say "Innocent until proven guilty". So, every indicidual is either innocent or guilty of an act. SO, this statement refers that everyone is innocent initially --> This is `null hypothesis(H0)` --> This refers to the rule that "H0 is the condition we believe to be true before we collect any data."
* Gulity --> is the `alternative hypothesis(H1)` --> "The competing alternative hypothesis is that an individual is guilty"
* We then collect data to see which hypothesis is supported.
*
